## Overview

The overall execution of this project was better than I expected. Really proud of the progress so far. However, I feel as if I hit a wall when it comes to decreasing the size of the viewport. By this, I mean I work from a 'desktop-first workflow' to a 'mobile-second workflow'. I underestimated mobile design, and now I'm having a hard time trying to decrease the size. This is probably my main priority at the moment, and I will start working with a 'mobile-first workflow'.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: 

## My process

My HTML process was straightforward:

--I started by adding the correct tags
--Then I grouped and name everyhting accordingly: i.e., I created a '.top-section', 'middle-section', and a 'bottom-section'. 

--I proceeded to add all the smaller containers within these sections

Next I began working on sizing and positioning my containers in order to better grasp the correct sizing of all images 

--Added all the fonts, colors, sizing

--Designed the buttons 

--created the circle and line with the number in the center

--finished off with adding media queries 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use the order: 1, with the flexbox CSS rule. This helped bring the .groupchat-info box, which also uses flex-wrap within the .top section, below the images so it can stay positioned below them.

I also learned how to create circles and lines. This was a pretty neat trick that gave me some insight into drawing with CSS. 

Lastly, this project tested my patience. There was no tutorial to follow along with this project, so I was left with no real live code to follow along with. However, I want to thank Atif for his solution. His code provided me with examples of where I can use display: grid for my 'image gallery', and his code was what pushed me to figure out the 'order' flexbox rule. Our code is entirely different, but it's incredible how you can have something similar with a different approach.
